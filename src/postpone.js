            Dear loved ones,
            <br />
            <br />
            We have decided to{' '}
            <b>
              <u>postpone our wedding</u>
            </b>{' '}
            — the lack of toilet paper should tell you why.
            <br />
            Your health means a lot to us. We want to see your sick dance moves,
            not to see you sick!
            <br />
            We know it took effort asking for timing off and booking travel to
            come to celebrate with us. We truly appreciate that.
            <br />
            <br />

            We are looking for a date after August for our new wedding date.
            <br />
            We will be providing more details to you once we figure them out.
            <br />

            Most airlines are offering refunds or credits for your flights.
            <br />
            Hotels should also be offering free cancellation.
            <br />
            We recommend using the airline or hotel websites to cancel your
            reservations because wait times for phone calls is very high.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!
            <br />
            <br />
            Stay healthy,
            <br />
            ❤️ Nancy & Anand
