            Dear loved ones,
            <br />
            <br />
            We have rescheduled our wedding to April 10th 2021
            <br />
            However due to the pandemic, we have made some changes to ensure the safety of our guests.
            <br />
            <br />
            While we wish we could celebrate with everyone, we have reduced the guest list.
            <br />
            We request guests get vaccinated or tested before attending the events.
            <br />
            We will be livestreaming the wedding events for anyone who cant make it.
            <br />
            We will share the livestream details soon.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!
            <br />
            <br />
            Stay healthy,
            <br />
